Fetch the Ubuntu release names from Wikipedia and print to the command-line.

## Motivation
This is kind of a joke about all these names being annoying to look up and remember, and then changing all the time. But also partly not.

## Installation
```
pipx install ubuntu-release-names
```

## Usage
```
ubuntu-release-names
```

## Caveats
This is machine parsing of human-readable data. An LLM would probably be more reliable, but then I would have to deal with API keys. Bet it doesn't break for a long time.
