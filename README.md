Fetch the Ubuntu release names from Wikipedia and print to the command-line.

## Motivation
This is kind of a joke about all these names being annoying to look up and remember (always yet another Ubuntu release name). This was particularly annoying when looking for packages across multiple versions.

## Installation
```
pipx install ubuntu-release-names
```

## Usage
You can output all the release names with:
```
ubuntu-release-names
```

The finall column is whether the relase is a long term release.

You can output the versions in `--json`

```
ubuntu-release-names
```

## Caveats
This is machine parsing of human-readable data. An LLM would probably be more reliable, but then I would have to deal with API keys. Bet it doesn't break for a long time tho.
